            "The relationship between school closure and influenza dynamics has been explored in a number of previous papers, with both epidemiological data and mechanistic models. ",

            "I am not totally convinced by this conclusion, as Table 1 shows that the change in level is not significant for Victoria, Australian Capital Territory, and Southern Australia, and the change in slope is not significant for Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia, and Southern Australia. ",
            "This is contrary to the section of the results that states that \u201cthe estimates for the initial effect and the subsequent slope show significant declines for all states except South Australia\u201d. ",

            "- The results also provide the percent of weeks in the pre-vacation, during-vacation, and post-vacation period in which there is a weekly decrease in influenza incidence, indicating that there is a higher proportion of decreases in the during and post-vacation period. ",

            "These software are not intended to be disseminated either as they are used only for checking and benchmarking or because they are very specific (for example a real-time software where the purpose is to save as much as possible computation time so that it cannot be general by essence as any general procedure will require tests that will penalize the performances) and therefore cannot be reproducible. ",
            "As developing software is time intensive having too strict rule for the evaluation of software (such as documentation and availability) may discourage researchers producing them although they provide some good idea of the efficiency of the underlying theoretical work.\n",

            "The CDUR procedure proposed by the authors is very fine but can be applied only on a limited number of RS types and his application will be disastrous for other types. ",
            "For example it is easy to find RS for which the CDU part is not relevant while the R part is the only one of importance: for example a RS that performs the control of a specific robotic system cannot be reproducible (unless the reviewer has at hand an exactly similar robot), its use is limited to a specific prototype (and the RS has been designed for it) and has to bey tailored to manage another system so it cannot be disseminated. ",
            "Hence the only evaluation criteria is the R part which is illustrated by the performance of the whole system, being given the performance of the hardware.\n",
            "- I recognize that the authors are right in term of objectives: our current approach of RS development may lead to a waste of time with researchers programming again and again the same algorithms instead on focusing on their specific objectives. ",

            "For example, respondents who disagree with the question \u201cI complete an IDP annually with my PI/advisor\u201d could have actually completed an IDP with their PI at the beginning of their postdoc and/or possibly in year 3 of their postdoc\u2014how much weight were respondents giving to the word \u2018annually\u2019? ",
            "Another question reads: \u201cI complete an IDP but I do not discuss it with my PI/advisor\u201d - could respondents complete two different IDPs - one with and one without their PI (and thus agree to both the former and latter questions)?\n",

            "Additionally, it would be helpful to point out the limitations of comparing these two studies (ex: address key differences between the two survey instruments regarding how the IDP questions were asked (and how this might bias responses), address potential respondent audience differences, etc.).\n",

            "It would also be especially helpful to ascertain what IDP tools are being used, and how they are being implemented so that standard \u2018correlates of effectiveness\u2019 could be tied to specific IDP instruments (or components) and the manner in which they are employed."

            "I think most of my concerns could be addressed though a follow up survey and additional analyses.",

            "I do not object to this assertion in principle (teaching with R has personally been a rewarding experience for me and most of my students), but the conclusion does not derive from the survey data, and the logic that underpins it is not always clear. ",
            "The authors cite some pedagogical papers on the general importance of programming knowledge, but the relative value of programming per se (as opposed to its applications) for disciplines apart from computing science are not self-evident given the assumed cost to other portions of the curriculum. ",
            "One could indeed use R markdown for lab report submissions, as the authors suggest on p.10, but I am not convinced that this would often be worth implementing if the main learning outcome sought is written communication skills. ",

            "Like the analyses of survey quality mentioned above, methods for conducting multinomial models and extracting multinomial CIs are readily available within R (e.g., see Villacorta 2012 ), and would allow the authors to both quantify uncertainty in their proportions and illustrate confidence limits for each response measure.",
            "Some of the comparisons suffer from a lack of context. ",
            "For example, Fig. 1 concerns the relative provision of R courses to undergraduates vs graduate students, but this contrast is difficult to interpret without more information on the number of courses in total that are offered to graduates and undergraduates. ",

            "The Case Report is extremely well written but, unfortunately, I feel that the basic premise of the paper is fundamentally flawed. ",
            "The authors argue that their patient with SCLC and hyponatremia did not have SIADH because plasma ADH levels were not elevated. ",
            "Since ANP levels were high, the authors propose that ectopic secretion of ANP was the cause of hyponatremia. ",
            "There are several problems with their argument. ",
            "First, unless done in a research laboratory, plasma ADH levels are extremely unreliable and are not recommended. ",
            "Second, even if they were measured correctly, ADH levels do not have to be \u201chigh\u201d to be abnormal in patients with hyponatremia; they merely have to be measurable , because ADH should be unmeasurable if the serum sodium is less than 135. ",
            "Third, even if ectopic ANP were the primary cause of hyponatremia, ADH levels would still be expected to be elevated secondarily because hypovolemia resulting from ANP-induced sodium wasting should stimulate ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary; i.e. ADH is inappropriately high, but not ectopically secreted. ",
            "Finally, like ADH levels, the finding of elevated ANP levels does not prove ectopic secretion (though the authors are correct that ectopic secretion of ANP is common in SCLC). ",
            "ANP is secondarily high in all causes of SIADH, because water retention expands plasma volume which results in ANP secretion and secondary natriuresis. ",
            "The fact that their patient was clinically euvolemic is more consistent with secondary secretion of ANP in response to water retention from SIADH. ",
            "If the primary problem were ectopic ANP and inappropriate natriuresis, the patient should have looked hypovolemic. ",
            "The fact that their patient failed to respond to demeclocycline is not definitive \u2013 some patients may not respond to maximum doses; furthermore, response to the drug would not distinguish between SIADH and secondary secretion of ADH due to ANP-induced hypovolemia. ",
            "The paper would have been more interesting if the authors had arranged for measurement of vasopressin levels in a research laboratory and if they had treated their patient with V2-receptor antagonist. ",
            "There are reported cases of hyponatremia with low levels of ADH, raising the possibility that some tumors secrete a substance that is not detected immunologically as ADH, but which acts as an antidiuretic hormone. ",
            "The high U osm is evidence that their patient was secreting an antidiuretic hormone \u2013 they might not have been able to measure it because of problems with their assay or because their patient was secreting an antidiuretic hormone immunologically distinct from vasopressin; unfortunately we can\u2019t tell which is true.",
            "In addition to the fundamental flaw that I see in the authors\u2019 argument, they make some statements that I don\u2019t agree with. ",
