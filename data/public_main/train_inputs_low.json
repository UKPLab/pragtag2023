            "It seems that the results in this manuscript could be compared more accurately with the (Hobin et al. 2014) data by showing the \u2018neutral\u2019 responses, rather than lumping them with \u2018does not agree\u2019 (see point 1 above). ",
            "Additionally, it would be helpful to point out the limitations of comparing these two studies (ex: address key differences between the two survey instruments regarding how the IDP questions were asked (and how this might bias responses), address potential respondent audience differences, etc.).\n",

            "\u2019 The manuscript would thus be strengthened by discussing IDP indicators that have been previously reported in the literature (such as measures outlined by (Hobin et al. 2014) - ex: the value of an IDP in helping with self-assessment, helping identify career paths, helping identify skills to strengthen, etc.). ",
            "Furthermore, (Davis 2009 2 ) reports an in-depth analysis of results from a Sigma Xi Postdoc Survey - identifying many positive correlates of success associated with postdocs who develop a written plan at the outset of their careers (ex: higher publication rate, grant submission rate, better supervisor relationships, etc.). ",
            "Since the main point of this manuscript is to discuss the use and effectiveness of IDPs among postdocs, it would benefit from elaborating upon such postdoc-specific contextual literature - as well as other literature that documents the general benefits of goal-setting, which is a primary function of IDPs (Locke et al. 2002 4 ).\n",
            "- (Minor) The authors indicate that \u201cadditional research is needed,\u201d and it would thus be beneficial to clarify the research questions that should be addressed. ",
            "For example, it seems that it would be useful to determine the effects of various parameters on IDP effectiveness such as: 1) when in training an IDP is completed; 2) inclusion/ exclusion of IDP components (such as self-assessment, career exploration, skill-building, goal-setting, etc.); 3) prior experience with/completion of an IDP as a PhD student; 4) completing an IDP of their own accord versus doing so because it is required; 5) receiving training on how to create/implement an IDP; 6) using a specific IDP instrument (ex: myIDP) versus an institutionally-developed IDP, etc..\n",
            "- (Minor) ",
            "As an additional point - since \u2018IDP effectiveness\u2019 is subjective as the authors point out, perhaps future studies should address better-defining these parameters so that common IDP evaluation methods can be adopted within the broader community. ",
            "It would also be especially helpful to ascertain what IDP tools are being used, and how they are being implemented so that standard \u2018correlates of effectiveness\u2019 could be tied to specific IDP instruments (or components) and the manner in which they are employed."
