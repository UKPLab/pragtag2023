# PragTag-2023 Shared Task Archive

This repository will archive the code and data for PragTag-2023: a shared task on **Low-Resource Multi-Domain Pragmatic Tagging of Peer Reviews** that took place as part of the [10th Argument Mining Workshop](https://argmining-org.github.io/2023/) at [EMNLP-2023](https://2023.emnlp.org). 

**ðŸš€ Coming soon!** We are packaging everything for long-term archival. To access the Shared Task materials in the meantime, please use our [Codalab competition page](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/13334), and don't hesitate to contact us if you need help.

## Abstract

> Peer review is the key quality control mechanism in science. The core component of peer review are the review reports -- argumentative texts where the reviewers evaluate the work and make suggestions to the authors. Reviewing is a demanding expert task prone to bias. An active line of research in NLP aims to support peer review via automatic analysis of review reports. This research meets two key challenges. First, NLP to date has focused on peer reviews from machine learning conferences. Yet, NLP models are prone to domain shift and might underperform when applied to reviews from a new research community. Second, while some venues make their reviewing processes public, peer reviewing data is generally hard to obtain and expensive to label. Approaches to low-data NLP processing for peer review remain under-investigated. Enabled by the recent release of open multi-domain corpora of peer reviews, the PragTag-2023 Shared Task explored the ways to increase domain robustness and address data scarcity in pragmatic tagging -- a sentence tagging task where review statements are classified by their argumentative function. This paper describes the shared task, outlines the participating systems, and summarizes the results.
